# Background

I really enjoy programming, so I write code quite often. Which means that my `Portfolio` section gets outdated quite quick. 

That's why I thought about creating a utility that automates the process of **recording** and **processing** my work, hence I came up with the name **PWRP**, which stands for **Personal Work Recorder Processor**. You can find this project [here](https://github.com/cezarmathe/pwrp).

# My plan for this utility

The utility should:

1. Download(*git clone*) my projects locally in a specific workspace
2. Extract some metadata from a special branch in that git repository
3. Export the combine metadata from multiple projects(repositories) and a couple more data related to the time of recording in a special **JSON** recording report file that is database-ready(this is useful if you have a dynamic website that loads information regarding your work from a database) and can be further processed, if needed
4. Process the report file into a certain container format: *markdown*, *CSV*, *HTML*(with Liquid)

I've been working on the project for almost a month now, but I didn't rush into the features until I had a solid code structure that I can then easily use to expand the project. This includes working with configuration easily, easy logging management between different packages and a proper CLI structure.

# The configuration

I chose the [toml](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) as I find it really straightforward to use from a user's perspective(and I also like it more than other data file formats)

# What I have acomplished so far

## Configuration

I use [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for handling the configuration file finding, opening and reading process; it also provides useful features like binding command line flags and environment variables to certain keys. If you'd like to see an example configuration file, you can find one [here](https://github.com/cezarmathe/pwrp/blob/master/pwrp.toml).
