I really enjoy programming, so I write code quite often. Which means that my `Portfolio` section gets outdated quite quick. 

That's why I thought about creating a utility that automates the process of **recording** and **processing** my work, hence I came up with the name **PWRP**, which stands for **Personal Work Recorder Processor**. You can find this project [here](https://github.com/cezarmathe/pwrp).

I decided to write this utility in **Go** because I love this programming language and it would be a very good opportunity for me to learn more about it.

# My plan for this utility

The utility should:

1. Download(*git clone*) my projects locally in a specific workspace
2. Extract some metadata from a special branch in that git repository
3. Export the combine metadata from multiple projects(repositories) and a couple more data related to the time of recording in a special **JSON** recording report file that is database-ready(this is useful if you have a dynamic website that loads information regarding your work from a database) and can be further processed, if needed
4. Process the report file into a certain container format: *markdown*, *CSV*, *HTML*(with Liquid)

I've been working on the project for almost a month now, but I didn't rush into the features until I had a solid code structure that I can then easily use to expand the project. This includes working with configuration easily, easy logging management between different packages and a proper CLI structure.

# The configuration

I chose the [toml](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) as I find it really straightforward to use from a user's perspective(and I also like it more than other data file formats)

# What I have acomplished so far

## Configuration

I use [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for handling the configuration file finding, opening and reading process; it also provides useful features like binding command line flags and environment variables to certain keys. If you'd like to see an example configuration file, you can find one [here](https://github.com/cezarmathe/pwrp/blob/master/pwrp.toml).

## Logging

I wanted to have a separate way of logging debug messages(with full caller name, more details etc.) from other logging messages(verbose, info, warn etc.) that does not force you to possess two logger([logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus)) objects and that can easily transfer logging details(like level and enabling debug messages) to other packages. 
Because of this, I created a *smartlogger* package that does just that. It wraps around **logrus** logger struct methods and it provides a couple of other useful methods, like reporting that a method has been called or it has returned(using the [runtime](https://godoc.org/runtime) package).

## CLI

For the Command Line interface, I used [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) to simplify using subcommands and flags.

## Configuration validation

The utility has a built in configuration validation system that checks the configuration each time it runs. You can also export a configuration file and validate it separately, which overwrites the previous file with the new changes(like adding protocols to URL's).

## Recording process

At the moment, the recording process loads the repositories listed in the configuration. Loading means:

- checking if the repository exists
- pulling remote changes if the already exists
- clone the repository if is doesn't exist locally
