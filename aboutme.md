title: About me

Hi, my name is Cezar, I'm 17 and I'm a student at the "Andrei Muresanu" National College in Dej, Cluj, Romania. I wrote my first line of code when I was 9 and I've been enjoying the experience since then.

Tinkering with my Linux system is one of my favourite things, along with writing Go code, Bash scripts and command line utilities.

Beyond my absolute favourite things, I participate in the [First Tech Challenge](https://natieprineducatie.ro/) program since season I and I can say that I've done any technical thing related to the robot: engineering, programming(in Java) and even piloting. I've also experimented with Python(during [DPIT](https://dpit.ro/), I was responsible with the [backend code](https://github.com/cezarmathe/smartplug-backend) and with some Discord bots), Ruby(I tried to make a Minecraft data pack command line utility, but I've never released it on Github), C#(back in the day when I was using Windows, I tried my luck with some Windows Forms applications), a TINY amount of Javascript and C++(at school and on a small [project](https://github.com/cezarmathe/linkedlist_cpp) which is a linked list implementation built with no includes).

I hope I didn't bore you with talking only about myself, thanks for reading this and if you wish to exchange a few words, [contact me](https://cezarmathe.com/contact)!
