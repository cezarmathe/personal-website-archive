title: About me
---

Hi, my name is Cezar, I'm 17 and I'm a student at the "Andrei Muresanu" National College in Dej, Cluj, Romania. I wrote my first line of code when I was 9 and I've been enjoying the experience since then.

Tinkering with my Linux system is one of my favourite things, along with writing Go code, Bash scripts and command line utilities.

Beyond my absolute favourite things, I participate in the [First Tech Challenge](https://natieprineducatie.ro/) program since season I and I can say that I've done any technical thing related to the robot: engineering, programming(in Java) and even piloting. I've also experimented with Python(during [DPIT](https://dpit.ro/), I was responsible with the [backend code](https://github.com/cezarmathe/smartplug-backend). If you'd like to see more of my work, please look [here](https://cezarmathe.com/portfolio)!

I hope I didn't bore you with talking only about myself, thanks for reading this and if you wish to exchange a few words, [contact me](https://cezarmathe.com/contact)!
